If you install Python in the user context,
you must consider the user context for invocation of the script - for example, from the OctoSAM Service Account.

If you have company-wide standards for Python installations, follow your standards.

Update pip and install the required Python modules.

The scanner uses the umapi-client for Python provided by Adobe, distributed via

If you have other applications that use Python on the same server,
it's recommended that you create a virtual environment to install the required modules.

pip install -r d:/OctoSAM/Server/Scanners/adobe_scanner/requirements.txt
